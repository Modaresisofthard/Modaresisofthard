HELLO.
I'm Seyed Mohammad Amin Modaresi.
I'm from Iran and I live in Yazd.
I live UK and I use UK keyboard and I learn British English. I love their accent.  It is very classy and beautiful.
For first( /fɔː(r)/ /fɜːst/  🙃😏)l learn C language and I share my simple codes.
Tell me if you have an opinion or something to improve me. 
I also hate Microsoft, Apple, Meta, Google, Intel, and any other monopoly, and I prefer to be in Gitleb, but unfortunately I can't use it because of sanctions, but if one day the sanctions are lifted, I will leave.  
Linux is better than Windows and Vim is better than VSC.
Freebsd and Netbsd is better than Windows.
